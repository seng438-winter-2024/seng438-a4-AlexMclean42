# Introduction


# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 
## Range Function:
```
89    public Range(double lower, double upper) {
90        if (lower > upper) {
91           String msg = "Range(double, double): require lower (" + lower
92               + ") <= upper (" + upper + ").";
93           throw new IllegalArgumentException(msg);
94       }
95       this.lower = lower;
96       this.upper = upper;
97   }
``` 


## Mutants:
### Survived Mutants:
- Line 90: removed conditional
  - replaced comparison check with false The test suite did not cover cases where lower > upper, so this mutant survived.
- Line 95: Decremented (a--) double local variable number 1
  - This mutant tells us that our test suite did not cover the case of changing the value of lower to be decremented by 1.
- Line 95: Incremented (a++) double local variable number 1
  - This mutant tells us that our test suite did not cover the case of changing the value of lower to be incremented by 1.
- Line 96: Decremented (a--) double local variable number 3
  - This mutant tells us that our test suite did not cover the case of changing the value of lower to be decremented by 3.
- Line 96: Incremented (a++) double local variable number 3
  - This mutant tells us that our test suite did not cover the case of changing the value of lower to be incremented by 3.
### Killed Mutants:
- Line 90: removed conditional - replaced comparison check with true
  - The original test suite had cases where lower was greater than upper, and it verified that an IllegalArgumentException is thrown in such cases.
- Line 95: Negated double local variable number 1
  - The test suite verified that lower is assigned correctly, so negating it would fail the test assertions.
- Line 95: Removed assignment to member variable lower
  - Similar to Mutant 95, the test suite verified that upper is assigned correctly, so negating it would fail the test assertions.
- Line 96: Negated double local variable number 3
  - Killing this mutant showed that our test suite ensures the correct setting of the upper bound.
- Line 96: Removed assignment to member variable upper
  - This mutant indicates that our test suite verified the proper initialization of the upper bound.
